In this collection, five videos illustrating static analyses are featured:

Plate:
'01_origami_finger.gif' showcases the static analysis of an origami finger, focusing on the compressive forces applied to the end nodes.
Kresling:
'02_origami_kresling.gif' depicts the static analysis of a kresling structure subjected to compressive forces on its top nodes.
Miura_ori:
'03_A_Miura.gif' presents a static analysis of a Miura origami unit cell, where the panels are actuated by changes in hinge angles.
Shelter:
'04_shelter.gif' reveals a static analysis of a shelter, highlighting the alterations in the rest lengths of its strings.
Kresling_str:
'05_Kresling_with_string.gif' displays a static analysis of a kresling structure where the strings' rest lengths are modified.
