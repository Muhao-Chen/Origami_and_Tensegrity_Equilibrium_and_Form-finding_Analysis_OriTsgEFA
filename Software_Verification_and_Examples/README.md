This folder includes five subfolders and a single file, each serving a specific purpose. The subfolders contain static examples that showcase the capabilities of OriTsgEFA, while the file serves as a straightforward interface for execution. By running the file 'auto_all_static_test.m', you can obtain results for all the provided examples.

For a deeper understanding of this software, we recommend starting with the '2kresling' file located in its respective folder.

'1plate': Features static analysis of a plate-based origami structure.
'2kresling': Conducts static analysis on a kresling origami structure without strings.
'3Miura_ori': Provides a static deformation analysis for a Miura origami unit cell. This example demonstrates that OriTsg accommodates large deformations in the structure.
'4Shelter': Carries out static analysis on a cable-driven shelter structure.
'5kresling_str': Contains a nonlinear static deformation analysis for a kresling origami structure with strings.
