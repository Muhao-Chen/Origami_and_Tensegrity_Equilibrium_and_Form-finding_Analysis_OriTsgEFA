% This function do the singular value decomposition of equilibrium matrix
% 
% Inputs:
%	A_1a: equilibrium matrix with constraints, force density as variable,
%	this variable can be changed to  A_1ag, A_2a, A_2ag
%
% Outputs:
%	U1: column space of A_1ag
%	U2: numspace space of A_1ag transpose: mechanism mode
%	V1: row space of A_1ag
%	V2: numspace space of A_1ag: prestress mode
